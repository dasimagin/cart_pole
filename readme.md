It is an educational project of [the robotics group](https://cs.hse.ru/robotics) (HSE/FCS). It is designed to learn the basics of optimal control and reinforcement learning.
The environment is a variation of the cart-pole problem described by Barto, Sutton, and Anderson.
A pole is attached by a joint to a cart, moving along a guide axis.
A stepper motor drives the cart. The control input is the cart's target acceleration.
The pole is initially at the rest state, and our goal is to swing up the pole and maintain its unstable equilibrium state.
There is also a radial variation where the cart moves in a circle.
