# CartPole

[![docs](https://github.com/robotics-laboratory/cart-pole/actions/workflows/docs.yml/badge.svg)](https://robotics-laboratory.github.io/cart-pole/)

It is an educational project of [the robotics group](https://cs.hse.ru/robotics) (HSE/FCS). It is designed to learn the basics of optimal control and reinforcement learning.
The environment is a variation of famous cart-pole problem.
A pole is attached by a joint to a cart, moving along a guide axis.
A stepper motor drives the cart. The control input is the cart's acceleration.
The pole is initially at the rest state, and our goal is to swing up the pole and maintain it in unstable equilibrium state.
There is also a radial variation where the cart moves in a circle.
